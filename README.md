#Title
JavaScript Code Quiz

#Description
This application is a multiple choice quiz.
This application contains five multiple choice questions pertaining to JavaScript.
To build this application, I utilized html, css, and javascript.
Building this application, I faced challenges with creating the javascript code for the project. I created and deleted multiple versions of this quiz, because I could not seem to connect the javascript functions to make them work. I specifically struggled with the javascript code for the score tracker. I input multiple versions of score tracker code and none seemed to take.
